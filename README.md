Button style is the design and visual appearance of a button element in HTML and CSS. Buttons are commonly used in web applications and interfaces to enable user interaction and trigger actions. The style of a button can be customized using CSS to match the design and branding of a website or application.

Button style typically includes properties such as background color, border, font color, padding, margin, and font size. These properties can be adjusted to create different shapes, colors, and sizes for buttons. Additionally, CSS can be used to add hover and active states to buttons, creating a more interactive and engaging user experience.

In GitHub, button style can be used in the repository description to add visual elements and make the description more engaging and interactive. Customizing the button style using HTML and CSS can help to create a more professional and polished look for the repository description.
